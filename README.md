# Server Side Caluclator 

## Description

Duration: 15-20 hours of work

When asked to build a simple server side calculator, I decided to put my own twist on it. I present you a Spanish/English calculator made for kids!

This simple calculator has more going on then meets the eye. The calculations and history of equations are on the server side. On the client side, I made simple text that changes from Spanish to English on cursor hover. This was made to be a educational tool for both English and Spanish speakers and those inbetween.
